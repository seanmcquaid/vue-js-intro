KEEP TEMPLATES SIMPLE! 

Create methods to compute value to abstract logic from templates

example :

instead of :

<span>{{ author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No' }}</span>

do : 

computed: {
    // a computed getter
    publishedBooksMessage() {
      // `this` points to the vm instance
      return this.author.books.length > 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No'
    }
    // can also have computed setter
  }

computed = more performant and doesn't invoke the function OVER AND OVER unless one of the dependencies has changed
